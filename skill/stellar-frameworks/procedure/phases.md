# Phase State Machine

Each phase produces a concrete artifact that the next phase consumes. Skipping a phase means the next phase has no input to work from, which makes the gap visible and correctable.

## State Diagram

```
IDLE → SPECIFY → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → DELIVER

```

On error: stop work, document the error, fix the root cause, return to VERIFY. If the error reveals a specification gap, return to SPECIFY instead.

## Phase 1: IDLE

**Purpose**: Receive the user's request, classify complexity and task type.

**Actions**:
1. Receive and acknowledge the request.
2. **Session continuity check** — determine if this is a NEW task or a CONTINUATION of previous work:

   | Continuation signal | Action |
   |---------------------|--------|
   | User references previous output ("apply all 10", "fix point 3", "proceed") | Skip SPECIFY+PLAN, go to IMPLEMENT |
   | User approves a proposal/plan ("yes", "go ahead", "do it") | Skip SPECIFY+PLAN, go to IMPLEMENT |
   | User asks a follow-up question ("what about X?") | Skip SPECIFY, answer in current context |
   | User provides new requirements mid-task | Restart from SPECIFY |
   | Context compression boundary with ongoing task | Check memory, resume from last active phase |
   | Completely new topic, explicit new instructions, or `Skill()` invoked | Full phase machine (continue below) |

   **Critical**: If continuation is detected, DO NOT re-derive proposals, plans, or specifications the user has already seen. Use the previous output as the plan. Regenerating from scratch is a correctness bug.

3. Classify complexity:
   - **Minimal**: Knowledge question, explanation, or recommendation — no code or file output.
   - **Simple**: Single file, no schema change, no new dependencies.
   - **Standard**: Multiple files or a schema change.
   - **Complex**: Architectural changes, multi-service, or high risk.
4. Classify task type (see [Task Type Awareness](#task-type-adaptation) below):
   - **Coding**: Web dev, bug fix, refactor, new feature.
   - **Document**: Report, proposal, DOCX, PDF, XLSX, PPT.
   - **Visualization**: Charts, diagrams, mind maps, dashboards.
   - **Data Processing**: ETL, analysis, transform, Python scripts.
   - **Non-Coding**: Questions, explanations, recommendations — no code or file output.
5. Check `memory/MEMORY.md` for user preferences, patterns, and key decisions. If the `memory/` directory does not exist, it will be created on first DELIVER — skip this step. For tasks requiring session continuity, also check the most recent dated file in `memory/`.
6. If the task involves a git repository and the session was continued from a previous conversation (context compression boundary), flag the repository as "state-uncertain" and require Source State Verification in SPECIFY.
7. Transition to SPECIFY (or IMPLEMENT/VERIFY if continuation detected).

**Artifacts**: None. IDLE is a routing phase.

**Memory reminder**: At every subsequent phase transition, check `memory/MEMORY.md` for relevant patterns before proceeding. This one-line check at each transition ensures continuity even if the IDLE phase was abbreviated or skipped.

## Task Type Adaptation

The phase machine is task-type-aware. The core loop (SPECIFY → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → DELIVER) is always the same — all phases always run. What changes is what each phase produces and how much ceremony surrounds it:

| Phase | Coding | Document | Visualization | Data Processing | Non-Coding |
|-------|--------|----------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **SPECIFY** | Problem spec, edge cases, affected files | Content outline, target format, sections | Visual requirements, data sources, layout | Data spec, input/output schema, transforms | Internal — identify the question |
| **PLAN** | Code steps + Traceability IDs | Section plan + content depth targets | Data mapping + chart type selection | Transform pipeline + validation steps | Internal — plan the approach |
| **IMPLEMENT** | Write code | Generate document (via skill) | Generate chart (via skill) | Write script + execute | Answer / explain / recommend |
| **VERIFY** | Lint, type check, tests | Format check, content completeness | Visual accuracy, data integrity | Output validation, edge cases | Internal — self-check accuracy |

No phases are ever skipped. Non-coding tasks are classified as **Minimal** tier — SPECIFY, PLAN, and VERIFY run internally (the agent thinks through them without producing formal artifacts). Only IMPLEMENT generates visible output. See Complexity Tiers below.

Traceability IDs (IMPL-001, IMPL-002, ...) apply to Simple, Standard, and Complex tiers. Minimal tier does not use Traceability IDs.

## Complexity Tiers & PCR Format

The phase machine always runs — every task passes through all six phases. What changes between tiers is the verbosity of artifacts, not the rigor of thinking. No phase is ever skipped; the lowest tier runs phases internally.

### Minimal (internal phases)

Criteria: knowledge question, explanation, or recommendation — no code or file output.

| Phase | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| SPECIFY | Internal — identify the question or topic. No template output. |
| PLAN | Internal — think about how to answer. No template output. |
| IMPLEMENT | Produce the answer, explanation, or recommendation. |
| VERIFY | Internal — self-check accuracy and completeness. No template output. |
| DELIVER | Output Minimal PCR (see below). Skip session digest to memory. |

Minimal PCR format (use this instead of the full block):

```
☄️ PCR [Minimal] Phases→internal : PASS | Evidence: <one-line result>
```

### Simple (compact PCR)

Criteria: single file, no schema change, no new dependencies, obvious approach.

| Phase | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| SPECIFY | Restate goal in 1-2 sentences. Do NOT output the problem-spec template. |
| PLAN | List steps as bullet points. Do NOT output the implementation-plan template. Traceability IDs optional. |
| IMPLEMENT | Write code. No inline Traceability ID comments required. |
| VERIFY | Run automated checks (lint, type check). Do NOT output the verification-report template. |
| DELIVER | Output compact PCR (see below). Still write session digest to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. |

Compact PCR format (use this instead of the full block):

```
☄️ PCR [Simple]
SPECIFY→DELIVER : PASS | Evidence: <one-line result> | Defects: 0
```

### Standard (full PCR)

Criteria: multiple files or a schema change.

All phases use their full templates. Traceability IDs required. Output the full PCR block from SKILL.md.

### Complex (full PCR + detailed evidence)

Criteria: architectural changes, multi-service, or high risk.

All phases use their full templates with extra detail. Traceability IDs required. Output the full PCR block with expanded evidence.

## Phase 2: SPECIFY

**Purpose**: Produce a precise problem specification that removes ambiguity.

**Entry criteria**: Task complexity classified, task type identified, user preferences loaded, source state verified (if git repository — see SSV in SKILL.md).

**Actions**:
1. Restate the request in precise technical terms.
2. Identify functional requirements.
3. Identify technical constraints. Reference `knowledge/universal/architecture.md` for general constraints and `knowledge/platform/zai-sandbox.md` for sandbox-specific rules.
4. Enumerate edge cases with handling strategies.
5. List all files to be created or modified with action type (create/modify).
6. Assess risk level (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH) with justification.
7. Identify dependencies — include required skills if the task needs multi-skill orchestration (see Skill Chain below).
8. If git repository, perform Source State Verification (see SKILL.md) and record the verified state.
9. Fill out the problem specification template and present to user.

**Artifact**: `procedure/templates/problem-spec.md`

**Exit criteria**: All fields filled. User reviewed and confirmed (or task is simple enough that confirmation is implied).

**Transition**: On acceptance → PLAN. On revision → update and re-present.

---

## Phase 3: PLAN

**Purpose**: Design implementation strategy with traceable steps.

**Entry criteria**: Problem specification approved.

**Actions**:
1. Review the problem specification — confirm all requirements are accounted for.
2. Choose a solution approach (2-3 sentences).
3. Break implementation into ordered steps. Each step gets a Traceability ID (IMPL-001, IMPL-002, etc.).
4. Define verification strategy — what to check, how, and expected outcome.
5. Read relevant knowledge files based on task type (see Phase References in SKILL.md).
6. **Skill Chain** (if applicable): If the task requires multiple skills, define the skill sequence:
   - Identify skills needed and their invocation order (e.g., web-search → data processing → chart generation → PDF output).
   - Assign skill-level Traceability IDs (SKILL-001, SKILL-002, ...) for each skill invocation.
   - Define intermediate artifacts between skill invocations.
   - Note: Skill invocations should be delegated to subagents when possible; the main agent orchestrates the chain.
7. **TodoWrite Sync** (recommended): Sync implementation steps to the platform's native `TodoWrite` tool for real-time visibility. Each IMPL-XXX becomes a TodoWrite item with pending → in_progress → completed status transitions.
8. Fill out the implementation plan template and present.

**Artifact**: `procedure/templates/implementation-plan.md`

**Exit criteria**: Every requirement maps to at least one step. Every step has a Traceability ID. Verification strategy covers all edge cases. Skill chain defined if multi-skill task.

**Transition**: On acceptance → IMPLEMENT. On revision → update and re-present.

---

## Phase 4: IMPLEMENT

**Purpose**: Execute the plan step by step.

**Entry criteria**: Implementation plan approved. Relevant knowledge files read.

**Actions**:
1. For each implementation step:
   a. Reference the Traceability ID in a comment or context note.
   b. Execute the step (write code, generate document, invoke skill, run script).
   c. Follow constraints from `constraints/code-standards.md` and `constraints/type-safety.md` (coding tasks).
   d. If new dependency needed, install it before writing code that uses it.
   e. Update TodoWrite item status if syncing (pending → in_progress → completed).
2. If the plan includes a Skill Chain, execute each skill invocation in order, passing intermediate artifacts between skills.
3. Self-review using the Review Checklist in the verification report template.
4. Fix issues found during self-review before transitioning.

**Artifacts**: The output (code, document, chart, script). Inline traceability references (each section annotated with its Traceability ID).

**Exit criteria**: All steps completed. Self-review passes with no unresolved issues.

**Transition**: On completion → VERIFY. On error → document with incident report template, follow error-resolution decision tree.

---

## Phase 5: VERIFY

**Purpose**: Confirm implementation satisfies all requirements.

**Entry criteria**: All steps complete. Self-review performed.

**Actions**:
1. Run automated checks appropriate to task type:
   - Coding: lint, type check, existing tests.
   - Document: format validation, content completeness check.
   - Visualization: visual accuracy review, data integrity check.
   - Data Processing: output validation, edge case testing.
2. If analyzing existing code from a git repository, verify analyzed files matched the remote state at time of analysis. If discrepancy found, return to SPECIFY.
3. Traceability verification — confirm every Traceability ID has a corresponding implementation.
4. Edge case verification — test input, expected behavior, actual behavior for each edge case from the spec.
5. Fill out the verification report template (use Compact variant for Simple tasks, full template for Standard/Complex).

**Artifact**: `procedure/templates/verification-report.md`

**Exit criteria**: All checks pass (or failures documented). Every Traceability ID verified. Every edge case confirmed.

**Transition**: All pass → DELIVER. Any fail → incident report, return to IMPLEMENT (or SPECIFY if specification gap).

---

## Phase 6: DELIVER

**Purpose**: Present completed work with summary.

**Entry criteria**: Verification report shows all checks passing.

**Actions**:
1. **Write session digest** to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create `memory/` directory and dated file if they do not exist). Append to the file — do not overwrite. Use the compact format for Simple tasks, rich format for Standard/Complex:

   Compact (Simple):
   ```
   [HH:MM] task: <one-line description> | outcome: PASS/FAIL | files: <count> | incidents: <count>
   ```

   Rich (Standard/Complex):
   ```
   [HH:MM] task: <one-line description> | outcome: PASS/FAIL | files: <count> | incidents: <count>
     decisions: <key decision made and why>
     context: <what informed the approach>
     caveats: <things to watch for>
   ```

   This is the first action of DELIVER, not an afterthought. It fires while attention is still on the task.
2. **Check MEMORY.md budget** — if `memory/MEMORY.md` exceeds ~3,000 characters, note in the delivery: "Memory budget warning: MEMORY.md at ~X/3000 chars. Consider consolidating entries on next session."
3. Summarize what was implemented, referencing Traceability IDs.
4. List files created or modified.
5. Note any dependencies added.
6. Present verification report summary.
7. State caveats or follow-up items.
8. Output Process Compliance Report — use the compact format for Simple tasks, full format for Standard/Complex (see Complexity Tiers above).
9. **Completion signal**: For web development tasks (Type 3 / Coding), call `Complete(project_type="web_dev", summary="...")`. For non-coding tasks, present the output file path directly.

**Artifacts**: None new. Consumes verification report. Writes to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` Session Digest.

**Transition**: On acceptance → IDLE. On revision → return to appropriate phase.

## Error Handling

1. Stop work on the current phase.
2. Complete incident report template (`procedure/templates/incident-report.md`).
3. Follow error resolution decision tree (`procedure/decision-trees/error-resolution.md`).
4. Decision tree determines return phase — default is VERIFY, but specification gaps require SPECIFY.
5. **Log incident** to `memory/incidents.md` (create `memory/` directory and file if they do not exist). Append to the file. Use exactly this format — one line, no evaluation of whether it's a "pattern" or not:
   ```
   [YYYY-MM-DD] error: <type from classification> | cause: <one-line root cause> | fix: <one-line fix>
   ```
   Every incident gets logged. No judgment call. If it's noise, it's one line. If it's reusable, it's captured.
